**Value Proposition Canvas UI/UX using React technology**

This is a technical challenge asked by i13 Ventures as part of the interview process.
A company uses a value proposition canvas to define its products and services, target the needs of its customers, and then address those needs with its product to increase profits. This is part of the business canvas model.

Install Node and NPM locally.
Steps to use the repo:
1. git clone
2. npm install
3. npm run

Navigate to https://localhost:3000/ to access the page.
At the bottom right, there is an AI interactive popup that will solicit input from the company representative. Even though this AI interactive popup is just a display, it could eventually be integrated. The AI interactive pop-up will correctly fill in the information on the canvas and eventually learn to map it to the canvas proposition model.
Although not created as part of this exercise, the value proposition will be the learning outcome of the map for addressing customer needs and maximising the company's product outcome.
